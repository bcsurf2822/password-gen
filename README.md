# Random Password Generator Project

This project was inspired by Scrimba and demonstrates the use of for loops and array manipulation to create a simple random password generator. The user can click a button to generate two random passwords from an array of characters and symbols.

## Key Features

- **Random Character Selection**: Implements `Math.random()` to select characters from a predefined array. Utilizes for loops to iterate through arrays and build random strings of characters.
- **Responsive UI with CSS**: Gained a deeper understanding of working with CSS to style elements.

## What I Learned

- Improved efficiency when working with CSS for styling and layouts.
- A deeper understanding of using `for` loops and how they work in together with arrays.

## How It Works

- By clicking the "Generate Passwords" button, two 10-character passwords are generated randomly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
